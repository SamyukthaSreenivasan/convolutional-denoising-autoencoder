# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement
The task seems to be about using a CNN to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which consists of hand-written digits. Additionally, noise is added to the data, implying that this project may involve denoising or handling noisy images.

## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model


## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded using mnist.load_data().
### STEP 2:
Data Preprocessing:
Training and test data are scaled to the range [0, 1].
The data is reshaped into 28x28 images with one channel (grayscale).
### STEP 3:
Data Augmentation:
Noise is added to the dataset with a noise factor to test how the model handles noisy input.
### STEP 4:
Design the model.
